Instructions - File Verification Scripts

1. Prepare the Source Files
Place the files you want to verify in the user's documents directory. Ensure there are no other files in this directory that you don't want to verify.

2. Generate Checksums for Source Files
Run the `checksumGeneratorFile.py` script to generate checksums for the source files.

python checksumGeneratorFile.py

3. Rename the Generated File to `previousChecksums.txt`

Rename-Item -Path "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\checksums.txt" -NewName "previousChecksums.txt"

4. Delete and Copy
Delete the files read in previous steps and copy the target files into the user's documents directory.

- Execute the delete command to remove all files in the user's documents directory:

    
    Remove-Item ~/Documents/* -Force
    

- Copy the target files into the user's documents directory:

    
    Copy-Item -Path "<location of Target Files>" -Destination "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\" -Recurse
    

5. Generate Checksums for Target Files
Run the `checksumGeneratorFile.py` script again to generate checksums for the new set of files.


python checksumGeneratorFile.py


6. Rename the Generated File to `currentChecksums.txt`


Rename-Item -Path "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\checksums.txt" -NewName "currentChecksums.txt"


7. Compare Checksums
Run the `checksumCompare.py` script to compare the checksums.


python checksumCompare.py


8. Review the Log File
A log file will be generated in the user's documents directory with the verification results. Review this file to ensure the migration test was successful.

By following these steps, you can verify that the files have been correctly migrated by comparing their checksums before and after the migration process.

Instructions - Data Validation Script

Requirements

    Python 3.6 or Higher: Ensure you are using a compatible version of Python.
    pandas Library: Install this library to handle data manipulation. 
    Install it using pip:

        pip install pandas



Setup

1. Prepare CSV Files:

    Source CSV (source.csv): Your source data file.
    Target CSV (target.csv): Your target data file after the data migration has been completed.
    Location: Place both files in your local Documents folder, or adjust the file paths in the script accordingly.

2. Running the Script:
    Open a terminal or command prompt.
    Navigate to the directory containing the script.
    Run the script with the following command:
            python data_validation.py

3. Review Results:
    Check the script's output in the terminal and the generated report file (validation_report.txt) in your Documents folder to verify if the data migration is 
    successful or if discrepancies are found.
